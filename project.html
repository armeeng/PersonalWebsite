                                                As I embarked on this project, my programming knowledge was quite limited, and it required a significant amount of learning before I could even start writing the program. I leaned on external resources like Google, YouTube, and ChatGPT for guidance. As the project evolved, my understanding expanded, and I gained valuable insights into various programming concepts and techniques. The gradual progress of the project allowed me to delve deeper into coding practices, problem-solving strategies, and effective development approaches. Each step of the journey was an opportunity to absorb new knowledge and refine my newly acquired skills.

                                                It then uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to fetch data from the specified URLs.
                                                The data is scraped from web pages containing NCAA basketball statistics and placed into a pandas data frame.

                                            <p>To compare two NCAA basketball teams, the code iterates through a schedule that
                                                contains all the teams that are playing, and creates 3 data frames for each team.
                                                These dataframes contain the performance metrics for each team, and the code subtracts the
                                                corresponding values between the two opposing teams to identify performance differences which are appended into 3 new data frames.
                                                These performance differences can be used to help predict the outcome of a single game, but it
                                                still needs quite a bit of work in order to be more accurate and reliable.

                                        </div>

                                            <p>The code then aims to summarize the differences in performance metrics between the two teams into a singular number.
                                                This is done by summing the columns of the comparison dataframes to see which team is statistically weaker. This number, along with
                                                the corresponding teams are appended into an excel sheet to keep track of all the games and predictions.
                                                However the main purpose of this code is to try and see if there are any statistics that should carry more weight than other statistics (see 'Tracking Statistics After Each Game')

                                            <p>After the completion of each game, the code is revisited.
                                                This time, when the code is run, the data frames are once again
                                                created for each team, but now since the final result of the game
                                                are known, we can see which statistics were important in deciding the
                                                outcome of the game. Example: if team1 has a higher 3pt shooting percentage
                                                than team2, and team1 won the game, we can say that 3pt% has a 1-0 win-loss record.
                                                After doing this for quite a few games and quite a few statistics, we get
                                                a win percentage for each statistic. The record for these statistics is appended to its own excel sheet
                                                and whenever a game is complete the code is ran and updates the excel sheet accordingly. These percentages can then be
                                                multiplied with the performance differences to add more weight to
                                                the statistics that have more relevance, and less weight to those that are
                                                not as important. This creates another comparison data frame which is identical to the
                                                previous one except this one is weighted based on the statistics.
                                            </p>

                                                web for live/final scores and appended them into the excel sheet. From there
                                                a seperate script is used to read the final scores from the excel sheet
                                                and assign a value to the winner and loser. Lastly, another script is used
                                                to keep track of how well the predictions did, and what games were predicted correctly.

                                            <p>The main objective of this project was to identify the most crucial 
                                                statistics in determining the outcome of a college basketball game. 
                                                It is an integral part of a larger project aimed at predicting the winner of college 
                                                basketball games with precision and reliability, and although this project does 
                                                'predict' winners, it does so in a very simple manner and this is something that can definitely be improved. 
                                                Although basketball games can be influenced by various uncertainties, achieving a higher accuracy 
                                                than sportsbooks would mark a significant success. While it is challenging to guarantee absolute 
                                                certainty in predictions, the goal remains to provide more reliable and accurate predictions.

                                                is how long it takes to run the code. For a single
                                                matchup to be processed, it takes about 15 minutes. During the peak
                                                of college basketball season there could be more than
                                                100 different games in a day, which would have a total run time
                                                of about 25 hours. There's just not enough time in the day for that.
                                                And if I wanted to wait for the games to finish and update the statistical
                                                records, I would have to run the code again, which would be another 25 hours.

                                        <p>In the desolate tapestry of existence, where the strands of reality are woven with both the ordinary and the enigmatic, we find the poignant saga of the chicken who dared to cross the road. The road, you see, was not merely an asphalt expanse but a metaphorical threshold that demarcated the boundaries of its own perception.

                                            The chicken, burdened by the weight of its feathers and the scars of its past, embarked on a journey that mirrored the human quest for meaning. The road represented the existential void that separates birth from death, ignorance from enlightenment. With each step it took, the chicken confronted the abyss of its own mortality, teetering on the edge of its feathered fragility. The road was not just a physical obstacle, but a psychological battleground where it grappled with its fears, uncertainties, and the haunting question: "Why?"
                                            
                                            In its somber eyes, we glimpse the reflections of our own quandaries. The road became an allegory for our own hesitations in the face of life's myriad choices and unanswerable riddles. The chicken's journey, while seemingly mundane, transcends the mundane, mirroring the very essence of human existence.
                                            
                                            As the chicken crossed from one side to the other, it was akin to crossing the tides of time, traversing the fleeting moments that constitute our reality. Its journey encapsulated the dichotomy of life: joy and sorrow, hope and despair, the known and the unknown. Its passage evoked empathy, forcing us to confront the abyss within ourselves.
                                            
                                            And so, we are left to ponder, why did the chicken cross the road? Was it a quest for sustenance, a longing for greener pastures, or an insatiable curiosity? Or could it be that the chicken's odyssey mirrors our own ceaseless search for purpose amidst the cosmic expanse? The road becomes not just a physical divide, but a metaphor for the infinite chasm of existence itself.
                                            
                                            In the end, the chicken's journey speaks to our shared humanity—the yearning to transcend our limitations, to bridge the gaps that separate us from the unfathomable truths that lie beyond. It reminds us that while our journeys may be solitary, they are also universally connected by the threads of uncertainty and the unrelenting pursuit of significance. Just as the chicken crossed the road, we too press forward, step by step, in pursuit of meaning amid the boundless enigma of life.
